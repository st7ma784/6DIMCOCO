   from src.losses import create_loss_function
   
   # Create experiment configuration
   config = ExperimentConfig()
   config.model.dimensions = 6.0
   config.training.learning_rate = 2e-3
   
   # Create loss function
   loss_fn = create_loss_function('norm_based', config=config.model)
   
   # Use in training...
